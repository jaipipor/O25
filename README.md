# O25: Bidirectional modelling of remote-sensing reflectance and IOP retrieval
The remote-sensing reflectance (R_rs) varies with the illumination and viewing geometry, an effect referred to as bidirectionality, or BRDF effect. Bidirectionality results from the combined effect of an anisotropic downwelling illumination that is scattered by water and particles in varying proportions as a function of the scattering angle, all of this modulated by the two-way interaction with a roughened sea surface. In the context of optical remote sensing, bidirectionality may be corrected, so that users can work with radiometric data that, ideally, only depend on the inherent optical properties (IOPs). This process transforms R_rs into a “corrected” or “normalized” R_(rs,N), referred to the sun at the zenith and the sensor zenith angle at the nadir. This work builds on a previous contribution (D’Alimonte et al., in review) that benchmarked published correction methods, showing the superior performance of the method by Lee et al. (2011, henceforth L11). Given the modularity and potential of L11, a new method of, named O25, has been developed, starting from L11’s framework. O25 has been calibrated with a recently published synthetic dataset, tailored to the present needs (Pitarch & Brando 2024). A comparative performance assessment using the same datasets as in D’Alimonte et al., concludes that O25 outperforms L11 at all wavelengths with a sufficient signal to noise ratio. O25 includes novel features such as the definition of its applicability range, first-order uncertainty estimates (in terms of replicability), and the option of reversing the bidirectional correction, targeting users interested in the actual illumination conditions for ecosystem studies. O25 is going to be implemented as the operational OLCI BRDF correction for next EUMETSAT processing in 2025 for the provision of Level 2 reflectances (Collection 4). O25’s look-up tables do not require the wavelength as input. Hence, the method can also be applied other in situ and satellite sensors, including hyperspectral ones, as far as few required bands for IOP retrieval are available. Upon strong spectral restrictions in terms of the number or width of the spectral bands, as for sensors such as Landsat/Sentinel 2, the IOPs retrieval component of O25 can easily be reformulated.
